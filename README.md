# Labyrinth Truths and Lies Game

This game is made with the programming language C++. The game is about a player who is stuck in a maze and must find a way to escape it. This is done by the player navigating a maze by talking to sentries (soldiers).
The player picks which sentry to approach and a question is randomly generated such as "What is Syeda's favorite color?" The sentry will give an answer. Then, the player will guess whether
the sentry is telling the truth or not by typing "y" for yes or "n" for no. Once the player answers correctly three times, the player escapes the maze!
